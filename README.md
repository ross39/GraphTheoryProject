# REGXP matcher
This is a project for my module Graph Theory

## Getting Started
To get started you need python 3 installed. To check just type ```Python3```

### Prerequisites
How to use the terminal/Command Promt and programming knowlege to understand the code

To run just simply run ```python3 main.py```

### Coding Style
This project is broken up into various classes and function as to avoid creating a god class

### Versioning
All source control and versioning was done using git

### Acknowlegements
Stackoverflow

Google

Dr Ian Mcloughlin's lecture slides and video tutorials(Much of this code was wrote before the videos were posted so although it turned out similar in the end, It wasn't a direct copy from the videos)

### Footnote
I had an issue with git. Unbeknown to me I had created two git repos by accident and every commit I made meant I added duplicates. As a result I had to delete some files from the master.
